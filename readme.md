### Demo
You can find a demo of this bookmarklet [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy1MdjickAI)

### Installation
Create a new bookmark in your browser, then copy/paste the minified code below into the URL field. 

You can customize the output using the optional variables at the top, and the template at the bottom. The default template is designed for use with the Dataview plugin. If you make changes I recommend using [Bookmarklet Maker](https://caiorss.github.io/bookmarklet-maker/) to minify and URI encode the bookmarklet.

### Usage
By default, clicking the bookmarklet creates a new Obsidian file from the main body of the article (similar to Readability view). Alternatively you can choose to create a file from a selection, by either selecting all (`CMD+A`), or just a portion of the page.

### Disclaimer

This bookmarklet may not work on all websites. If you run into issues, you can also try the [MarkDownload browser extension](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/markdownload-markdown-web-clipper/173) which provides similar functionality.
