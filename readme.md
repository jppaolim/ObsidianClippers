## Demo
You can find a demo of this bookmarklet [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy1MdjickAI)

## Installation
Create a new bookmark in your browser, then copy/paste the code below into the URL field.

## Usage
By default, clicking the bookmarklet creates a new Obsidian file from the main body of the article (similar to Readability view). Alternatively you can choose to create a file from a selection, by either selecting all (`CMD+A`), or just a portion of the page.

## Disclaimer

Note that this bookmarklet may not work on all websites. If you run into issues, you can also try the [MarkDownload browser extension](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/markdownload-markdown-web-clipper/173) which provides similar functionality.
